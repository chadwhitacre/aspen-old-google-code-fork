========================================
    INTRO & INSTALL
========================================

This is a quick orientation to writing documentation for Aspen. Aspen uses the
Python documentation system:

    http://docs.python.org/doc/doc.html

The reasons for using this system are as follows:

    - it generates documentation in a variety of formats
    - the markup isn't that hard
    - the HTML it generates looks familiar to Python programmers

Python's doc system is basically a tweaked LaTeX, so googling for LaTeX-related
search terms will also yield useful information. The tools for this system come
with the full Python source distribution. You'll also need latex2html, which I
install on FreeBSD with:

  # pkg_add -r latex2html

This is a nasty Perl script(?!), so you'll need Perl too.


========================================
    WORKFLOW
========================================

Basically, all documentation starts life in the tex/ subdirectory, and from
there, the Makefile generates HTML and PDF versions. Also in there is an
update.py script which repeatedly makes the docs whenever the source files
change: this is useful during development. When update.py exits, it calls make
clean which removes the built HTML and PDF docs too.

When the docs are made, the HTML version will be in the html/ subdirectory, and
I usually serve that directory with Aspen itself. So my doc dev cycle looks
like:

  1. make the html subdir if it isn't already there
  2. start Aspen as a daemon in the html directory (`aspen start -rhtml`)
  3. change into tex/ and start update.py
  4. open the fresh html docs in a browser
  5. open a tex file in my editor and edit it
  6. watch latex2html churn, and then refresh my web browser


Hopefully that's enough to get you started. Please keep lines to 80 chars, and
in general try to harmonize your style with the existing docs.
