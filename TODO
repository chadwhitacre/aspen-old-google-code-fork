replace jinja2 with tornado templating
move magic dir from __ to .aspen
    don't serve hidden files
===POSTPONED===
make aspen non-blocking (tornado? diesel? etc.?)
===DONE===
make it so /n/ != /n
change default handlers to stdlib simplates
bring over webob/jinja2 simplates from nest
    make this the only flavor of simplates (1 vs. infinity)
simplify extension points
    no more apps
    no more handlers--everything runs through Simplates
    keep middleware around, I think
    keep urlmap around, definitely (but rename?)
