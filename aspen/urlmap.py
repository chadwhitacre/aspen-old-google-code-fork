"""URL routing helper for Aspen.

This module defines a middleware (called 'middleware') that routes URLs based
on PATH_INFO, where "route" means to alter PATH_INFO and set a bunch of extra
keys in environ. The file __/etc/urlmap.conf defines the routing configuration,
with each line containing one or two whitespace-separated tokens. The first
token is a regular expression to match against the incoming PATH_INFO. The
second token, if present, is the new PATH_INFO. If there is no second token,
then any matching requests will be permanently redirected to PATH_INFO plus a
trailing slash. Processing stops with the first match.

Groups matched in the regular expression are added to the WSGI environ. All
groups area available using the string of their index in the pattern;
additionally, named groups are available under their name. All names (explicit
or indexed) are prefixed with 'urlmap.'. You can change this prefix by setting
the 'prefix' knob in a [urlmap] section of __/etc/aspen.conf.

By default, any direct requests for a PATH_INFO mentioned as a second token in
urlmap.conf will be responded to with 404. This behavior can be overridden by
setting the 'allow_direct' knob in aspen.conf to any value.

This module was inspired by Django's urls.py routing.
